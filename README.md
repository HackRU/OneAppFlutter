## Description
*What is the purpose of this project?*

A cross-platform mobile application for hackers, organizers, mentors, and sponsors at the HackRU. HackRU is a 24-hour hackathon at Rutgers University. Hackers would be able to get announcements, a QR code for checking, food, t-shirts, as well as see the schedule and map for the hackathon. Organizers & Volunteers would be able to scan hacker's qr code for check-in, food, t-shirts, etc. In backend, we utilize qr scanning data for analytics that can be used after or even during the hackathon. Any more ideas to expand this project are always welcome.

## Inspiration
*How did this project come to be?*

We had started using an inhouse hybrid mobile application to keep track of analytics to get a better idea of how certain aspects of the hackathon were running such as food consumption and optimization for checkin. This project expanded into a public native mobile application so hackers had easier access to their QR code as well as organizers with their scanners. Additional information of the hackathon were incorporated so that everyone would be able to stay up to date on events that are happeneing wherever they may be in the venue.

## Style Guide
Most of the recommended lints directly implement the guidelines set out in [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart). In a few cases the lints are stricter than the style guide for the sake of consistency.
